Steps file format:
The first line of the steps file is going to consist of one char, which is going to represent the number of ghost in the screen.
Every line starting from the second one is going to represent one "point in time"(the time it takes pacman to move one step) or one step.
Each step(line), start with the direction of pacman at that step, followed by a space. Then it's going to have the direction of every ghost by order, 
with a space between each ghost. And then the last part of the step is reserved for the fruit. If the fruit does not exist it will say '*' and end with a space.
Otherwise, if the fruit exists, we eill get it's direction, followed by a space. And then the x and y coordinates in the following format "X,Y"
(X and Y can be either 1 or 2 digits) followed by another space.
The last char of the format will be the value of the fruit(again, if it exists at this point of time), followed by a space.
Note:if a '*' appears where a ghost direction is supposed to be, it means the ghost keeps it's current direction.

Example(purely to expain the format, might not actually work for any map):
2
S S S *
D X W *
D X W S 1,3 7
D X W D 2,3 7
D X W D 3,3 7



Result file format:
The first char of every line is either 'D' or 'F' followed by a space, and then N characters representing digits fo a number(N >= 1).
'D' stands for Death and this means this line represents a point in time where pacman died, the number on this line specifies the point in time.
'F' stands for Finish and means this line represents a point in time where the screen was finished, the number on this line specifies the point in time.
'F' will only appear at the last line of the file, if at all.

Example:
D 15
D 63
F 122

This example represents a game where the pacman died twice before finishing the game.
The first time is 15 'steps' after the game began, and the second time is 63 'steps' after the game began.
The screen was finished after 122 'steps'.
